2. `Cmd+Shift+P` - Run any command
3. `Cmd+D` - Multi-select text
4. `Cmd+F` - Find in file
5. `Cmd+Shift+F` - Find in project
6. `Cmd+.` - Quick fix
7. `F2` - Rename symbol

### Code Navigation Patterns
**Efficient workflows for large codebases:**

1. **Find and explore:** `Cmd+P` ‚Üí type filename ‚Üí `Cmd+Click` definition ‚Üí `Shift+F12` find references
2. **Refactor safely:** Select symbol ‚Üí `F2` rename ‚Üí `Cmd+.` for quick fixes
3. **Debug workflow:** `F9` set breakpoint ‚Üí `F5` start debug ‚Üí `F10/F11` step through

### Project Setup Best Practices
```bash
# Recommended project structure
.vscode/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settings.json      # Project-specific settings
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.json         # Build/test tasks

## üö® Troubleshooting & Performance

### Common Issues & Solutions
| Problem | Solution | Prevention |
|---------|----------|------------|

| **IntelliSense not working** | Reload window, check language server | Ensure proper project setup |
| **Git integration broken** | Check git path in settings | Keep Git updated |
| **Extension conflicts** | Disable extensions one by one | Read extension descriptions carefully |

### Performance Optimization
```json
// Settings for better performance
{
  "search.exclude": {
    "**/node_modules": true,
    "**/dist": true,
    "**/.git": true
  },
  "files.watcherExclude": {
    "**/node_modules/**": true
  },
